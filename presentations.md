# Presentations

For the presentation, you will have a 10 min slot to share what you've learnt and what you've built with the class, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:
 - show pictures of wireframes or sketches, notes, diagrams from your planning stage. Please include documentation of user needs and journeys if you have these (it helps)
 - demo your app's functionality
 - talk about and explain one piece of code that you are particularly proud of
 - highlight your main learning points from the week

Try not to:
 - Go over the time limit
 - Talk through every single line of code
